                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Present, Viona "Venusia" Frostav, A profound ranger from the north. 
                        Her survivalist and environmental skills are unmatched by those who roam
                        the forests, scale mountains, and sail the seven seas. 
                        She is 171 cm (about 5'6''), and around 24 years old.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She has done many deeds under Isenfjord's company Tundra Exploration Group 
                        and currently sits at Prospect Rank 4 out of 78 highly regarded explorers 
                        who are also competent in their field of expertise. 
                        Viona's skills often correlate with Reconnaissance, specifically scouting, 
                        sneaking, and gathering information before another team explores an area or executes 
                        their plans. Many people in her company called her "The Sweet Informant" because of 
                        her unusual timing and overall sweet personality. 
                        Her favourite outfit to wear consists of a cross-over swimsuit under 
                        her bluish-white snow fur cloak, Diamond & Moon pendants, and a headband with 
                        a Tengu Mask and a rose that she put on her hair. Odd choice of fashion, 
                        people said around her. She is also revered as the "Ice Maiden", 
                        a title hailing from her hometown of Rhiljak. 
                        Viona proved herself to be different from other Ice Heroes, 
                        due to having learned High-Powered Cryomancy almost instantly during 
                        an incident in her childhood. An incident which changed the 
                        course of Viona’s life…
                    </p>
                </article>
                <article class="card">
                    <h2>Origins</h2>
                    <p>
                        "A Gift from the Gods" the so-called incident. It all started with 
                        Viona and her also-young Cryomancer Apprentice friends that were 
                        trailing a Yeti's mark until they found a pool of Flash Water. 
                        This Flash Water is very dangerous to organisms, due to its ability to 
                        instantaneously freeze with even the slightest amount of friction, 
                        and Viona just so happens to encounter a pond of it. One of her friends 
                        proposed that someone needs to give it a little touch to create a cool 
                        reaction. Viona was selected to be the one to give it, and in a moment 
                        of serenity and an obvious incoming tragedy waiting to happen, gave the 
                        still waters a tap, but the water didn't immediately freeze. Viona, 
                        confused with what is happening, loses her focus and slips and falls 
                        to the pond. Her friends saw her surface a moment later encased in 
                        an amber of ice pristine, and called help to the Elder Cryomancers 
                        to deal with this awful situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The girl woke up in a room filled with tools, staffs, and a sort of 
                        limestone, steam, and piped mechanism looms over her. As she was looking 
                        around the room, scanning, she saw the leader of the Elder Cryomancers, 
                        Vrofja, a tall man, about 183 cm with a greenish-grey cloth-material 
                        ribbon cloak, a tool belt serving as storage, 2 dark marble gauntlets, 
                        1 on each hand, as well as wendigo skulls on each side of their shoulder 
                        serving as an armor guard or some sorts. 
                        Vrofja told her that she was in a comatose state for 2 weeks. 
                        He recalled the testimonies given by her nearby friends that day 
                        and was still baffled by what they saw during the incident. 
                        Viona asked if she was okay and if she needed to take medicine 
                        or something. She stood from her bed, a blue flash emitted from 
                        behind her as well as sudden release of Flash Water caused the room to 
                        immediately freeze on crash, with slowly-emerging frozen spikes on the walls. 
                        Vrofja tightens his grip on his gauntlets, 
                        shocked by the concentration of Cryo inside of her body, 
                        it’s as if she was possessed by the might of Cryo itself. 
                        “Stop, Do not touch… anything with your hands… for now.” <br>
                        “You… are he… The legacy.” <br>
                        He proclaimed, pointing at the now newly born “Ice Maiden”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Viona graduated from her Cryomancy institute 3 days after the incident 
                        and was moved to another more renowned university in her hometown, 
                        Torvald High, that also has Vrofja working as the President. 
                        Viona received her first training day with Vrofja in the university’s 
                        Peninsula, along with other Apprentices and Scholars. 
                        The Peninsula itself is an area of Torvald high that was established 
                        from an ice crater turned into a huge multi-functional open field. 
                        The first task the High Elder gave to Viona was to see if she could 
                        recall the basic training she got from her previous education. 
                        Effortlessly, she breezed through all of her 6 years' worth 
                        of Cryomancy training and performed its little magic spell tricks to boot. 
                        No signs of amnesia here, thought the High Elder. 
                        Next, Vrofja’s second task was to recall things from the “past”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “What do yo-” Viona spoke briefly but could not finish her question, 
                        as she was interrupted by the happenings before her eyes.
                        Vrofja pointed his Grand Caster Spear to her, which was 
                        immediately disarmed with a strange, quick, 
                        and solid spike of ice emerging from the ground between them. 
                        The Grand Caster Spear was knocked 30 meters off the High Elder’s 
                        arm and landed in an innocent bystander’s soup. 
                        Vrofja, quickly and seemingly with the calmest expression ever, 
                        recoiled and backed away from the spike. Viona, startled, shocked, 
                        maybe even flabbergasted, 
                        started screaming to the High Elder questions from panic. 
                        “I see”, The High Elder thought, but his train of thoughts was cut 
                        short by the appearance of more Ice Spikes and massive Ice Pillars 
                        forming from the ground below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “WHAT IS HAPPENING???!!!” Viona yelled in confusion.
                        An aura of frost and roaring wind covered her, as if she herself 
                        is the eye of the storm.  
                        The formation speed hastens, prompting the High Elder to leap 
                        from his position to one of the forming pillars. 
                        While this was happening inside the university’s Peninsula, 
                        The High Elder made an observation that the ice formations 
                        included extremely large concentrations of Flash Water inside the amber, 
                        and was introduced to the environment after Viona received 
                        a slight amount of threat stimulus. He whirled himself to Viona 
                        for the final time from a pillar and recalled his Grand Caster Spear 
                        from the broken table and the soup bowl to his gauntlet, 
                        followed by a mighty charged upswing, yes, with his spear’s blunt part, 
                        in hopes that it could stop the formation and get close to Viona.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The formations of ice were successfully stopped. 
                        <br>“Calm yourself!” He told Viona.<br> She was unresponsive during all of this, 
                        trying not to spiritually implode from the intense icy wind she made. 
                        But after the voice speaks to her, she crumbles to the ground, 
                        like the twigs of the high trees, 
                        finally submitting to nature’s wrathful tempest. 
                        The formation stopped growing and instantly crumbled to the ground, 
                        just like its master. The High Elder stepped forward, 
                        put his hands on her shoulder, and spoke <br>“Young one, gather yourself. 
                        Pure emotions are a must in harboring Cryo powers such as you.”
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The High Elder ended the day early for all attendants of the university 
                        and spent mourning with Viona, his apprentice. 
                        He told the one before her bears a significant amount of chivalry 
                        and loyalty towards his city, pledging to work with Cryomancers to \
                        defend Rhijlak, losing him in a heroic sacrifice was the 
                        most regretful he had been all his life. <br>

                        “But do not fret, you are still young.” “This time, there will be no 
                        regrets, no loss, no sorrow, nothing harmed. I, 
                        The High Elder of the Cryomancers with utmost dedication, 
                        valor, and chivalry, am willing to train you… and protect 
                        you to the very end.” <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Viona was shocked and yet still calm hearing herself bearing a curse, 
                        maybe even a blessing from her predecessor. In her defeated pose, 
                        she rose and grabbed her teacher’s arm, and looked up 
                        to the High Elder’s eyes. 
                        <br>“Teach me, sensei!” she spoke with vibrant starry eyes.<br> 
                        “Sensei? What is-” <br>
                        “I meant- Teacher!!”<br>

                        “You will face many difficult challenges ahead, 
                        and meet friends along the way. You bear a blessing  that 
                        you did not choose yourself, but it has chosen you. 
                        I will train you until you have mastered the art of Cryo. 
                        Your journey starts here… Guardian Ice Maiden.”
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        "Ice Maiden" is her Ice Hero title, 
                        there are many special people bearing an Ice Hero title such as 
                        "White Sentinel", "Frozen Shield", "Eidolon Huntress", 
                        "Glaciia", "Specter of Noshavn" 
                        and the most recent Ice Hero before her, 
                        "The Knightingale". These Ice Heroes have a much higher 
                        sensitivity to the power of Cryo, which allows them to cast massive 
                        Cryomancy spells with ease and have massively increased sensitivity 
                        to Cryo. People have sought and looked up to them because of their 
                        immense, almost anomalous ways of controlling the element 
                        of the Tundra itself, so much so that some of the heroes decided 
                        to help themselves and their own people in secret, and sometimes being 
                        a vigilante in the night.

                                As childish as it may seems, Viona likes to surprise children 
                                of Isenfjord by disguising herself as a winter's gift. 
                                She then appears as "The Warmest Present" to the kids, 
                                managing and giving winter presents among them. 
                                Children love her silly antics, 
                                while the parents are more at ease, seeing their young ones 
                                safe and cheerful. In the end, 
                                she's glad that she can share her happiness with them 
                                in the night of the winter.

                                things, she also rocks explosives to bring, her instant serotonin on the battlefield.

                                space for medical needs, for him and everyone in his team. Erik knew that the raging fire of
                                suffering and famine doesn't stop in Eieschster. So, he embarked on a journey, to Isenfjord,
                                in hopes of learning new medical knowledge and healing skills to bring back to his homeland.
                                Viona's dubbed him as the best friend and the most reliable mate
